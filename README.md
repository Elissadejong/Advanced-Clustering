# Advanced Clustering

The only purpose for this repository is to share the advance clustering class exercices.

## Instructions

1. Open an `Issue`

2.  In your issue comments post the link to you own repository (as we did in previous projects)

3.  Make sure your repository is `public` so every one has access to it.


Enjoy coding!!
