# Advanced Clustering

The only purpose for this repository is to share the advance clustering class exercices.

## Instructions

1. Open an `Issue` making sure that you write your name in the title.

2.  In your issue comments post the link to you own repository (as we did in previous projects).

3.  Make sure your repository is `public` so every one has access to it.


Enjoy coding!!
